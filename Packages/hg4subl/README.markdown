# Sublime Text 2 plugin: hg
A simple Sublime Text plugin for hg. I am calling it hg4subl. Its completely inspired by [sublime-text-2-git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git/wiki) which I use.

The plugin can upgrade itself unlike git version :)
Tools -> Hg -> hg4subl updates



## Installation:
**On Linux and *nix platforms:**

    cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Package
    hg clone http://code.thejeshgn.com/hg4subl

The "hg" binary can be specified with the setting "hg4subl_hg". For example by putting this in your user settings:

On Linux

    "hg4subl_hg": "/opt/local/bin/hg"

on Mac

    "hg4subl_hg": "/usr/local/bin/hg"
    

*Not tested on other envs*


## For updating to latest version:
Tools - Hg - hg4subl updates
